# Card Payment Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up card payments using Flutterwave's Card API in your Trading Academy application.

## üìã Overview

Card payments allow customers to make secure payments using their credit or debit cards. The integration uses Flutterwave's Card API to process payments securely and efficiently, following PCI DSS compliance standards.

**Supported Card Networks:**
- Visa
- Mastercard
- American Express
- Verve
- Afrigo

**Supported Features:**
- Secure payment processing
- Real-time payment confirmation
- Webhook notifications
- Multiple currency support
- 3D Secure authentication
- PCI DSS compliance
- Customer and payment method management

## üîß Environment Variables

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Flutterwave Configuration
FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_flutterwave_public_key
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=your_flutterwave_secret_key
FLUTTERWAVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_flutterwave_webhook_secret
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Flutterwave Dashboard Setup

1. **Create Flutterwave Account**
   - Sign up at [Flutterwave Dashboard](https://dashboard.flutterwave.com)
   - Complete account verification and KYC
   - Enable card payment feature in your account

2. **Get API Keys**
   - Navigate to Settings > API Keys
   - Copy your Public Key and Secret Key
   - Add them to your `.env` file

3. **Configure Webhooks**
   - Go to Settings > Webhooks
   - Add webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/flutterwave`
   - Set webhook secret (save this as `FLUTTERWAVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
   - Select events: `charge.completed`, `charge.failed`

4. **Enable Card Payments**
   - Contact Flutterwave support to enable card payments for your account
   - Ensure your account supports the currencies you need
   - Verify PCI DSS compliance status

### 2. Payment Flow

1. **User selects Card Payment** on subscription page
2. **User enters card details** (securely encrypted)
3. **System creates customer** in Flutterwave
4. **System creates payment method** with encrypted card data
5. **System initiates charge** with customer and payment method IDs
6. **User completes 3D Secure** authentication if required
7. **Flutterwave sends webhook** when payment is confirmed
8. **System activates subscription** automatically

### 3. API Endpoints

- **Card Payment Initiation**: `POST /api/user/subscription/activate`
- **Webhook Handler**: `POST /api/webhooks/flutterwave`
- **Payment Success Page**: `/payment/success`

## üíª Implementation Details

### Card Payment Processing

The system follows Flutterwave's recommended flow:

#### Step 1: Create Customer

```typescript
// Request payload
{
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone_number": "+1234567890"
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Payment Method

```typescript
// Request payload
{
  "type": "card",
  "card": {
    "encrypted_card_number": "ENCRYPTED_CARD_NUMBER",
    "encrypted_expiry_month": "ENCRYPTED_EXPIRY_MONTH",
    "encrypted_expiry_year": "ENCRYPTED_EXPIRY_YEAR",
    "encrypted_cvv": "ENCRYPTED_CVV",
    "nonce": "RANDOMLY_GENERATED_NONCE"
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Initiate Charge

```typescript
// Request payload
{
  "tx_ref": "TA_1234567890_abc123",
  "amount": 29.99,
  "currency": "USD",
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "fullname": "John Doe",
  "phone_number": "+1234567890",
  "redirect_url": "https://yourdomain.com/payment/success",
  "customer_id": "CUSTOMER_ID",
  "payment_method_id": "PAYMENT_METHOD_ID",
  "meta": {
    "subscription_id": "subscription_uuid",
    "payment_method": "card",
    "customer_name": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

### Response Handling

Successful card payment initiation returns:

```typescript
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Charge initiated",
  "data": {
    "id": 407347576,
    "tx_ref": "TA_1234567890_abc123",
    "flw_ref": "FLW-REFERENCE",
    "status": "pending",
    "auth_url": "https://checkout.flutterwave.com/v3/hosted/pay/FLW-REFERENCE",
    "payment_type": "card",
    "customer": {
      "id": 254967086,
      "email": "customer@example.com",
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  }
}
```

### Webhook Processing

The webhook handler processes `charge.completed` events:

```typescript
// Webhook payload
{
  "event": "charge.completed",
  "data": {
    "id": 407347576,
    "tx_ref": "TA_1234567890_abc123",
    "flw_ref": "FLW-REFERENCE",
    "amount": 29.99,
    "currency": "USD",
    "status": "successful",
    "payment_type": "card",
    "customer": {
      "id": 254967086,
      "email": "customer@example.com"
    },
    "meta": {
      "subscription_id": "subscription_uuid"
    }
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Environment

1. **Use Flutterwave Test Mode**
   - Set `NODE_ENV=development` in your `.env`
   - Use test API keys from Flutterwave dashboard
   - Test with small amounts (e.g., $1.00)

2. **Test Card Payment Flow**
   - Select Card Payment on subscription page
   - Enter test card details
   - Verify payment initiation works correctly
   - Test webhook processing (use ngrok for local testing)
   - Verify subscription activation

3. **Test Scenarios**
   - Successful card payment
   - Failed payment
   - 3D Secure authentication
   - Network errors
   - Invalid card details

### Test Card Details

Flutterwave provides test card details for successful payments:

```typescript
// Test card details
{
  "cardNumber": "5531886652142950",
  "cvv": "564",
  "expiryDate": "09/32",
  "pin": "3310",
  "otp": "12345"
}
```

### Test Data

```typescript
// Test card payment data
{
  "method": "card",
  "amount": 29.99,
  "currency": "USD",
  "description": "Trading Academy Subscription - Pro Plan",
  "customerEmail": "test@example.com",
  "customerName": "Test User",
  "cardDetails": {
    "encryptedCardNumber": "encrypted_card_number",
    "encryptedExpiryMonth": "encrypted_expiry_month",
    "encryptedExpiryYear": "encrypted_expiry_year",
    "encryptedCvv": "encrypted_cvv",
    "nonce": "randomly_generated_nonce"
  },
  "subscriptionId": "test-subscription-uuid"
}
```

### Mock Testing

Flutterwave provides mock testing capabilities:

- **Successful Transaction**: Append `_success_mock` to your `tx_ref`
- **Failed Transaction**: Append `_failed_mock` to your `tx_ref`

Example:
```typescript
// Successful mock payment
"tx_ref": "TA_1234567890_abc123_success_mock"

// Failed mock payment
"tx_ref": "TA_1234567890_abc123_failed_mock"
```
